------------------------------------------------------------[  DESCRIPTION  ]--

This program takes in 2 arguments from the command line and prints a Cool S 
design to stdout. The first input will be the size of the Cool S in the format 
(4n + 3) for size, and the second input will be the character to display inside 
of the Cool S ( e.g. 'a', '#', etc. ). 

Example: ./pa1 7 'a'

	   ^   
 	  /a\  
	 /aaa\ 
	/aaaaa\
	|aa|aa|
	|aa|aa|
	\aa\aa/
	 \aa\/ 
  	 /\aa\ 
	/aa\aa\
	|aa|aa|
	|aa|aa|
	\aaaaa/
	 \aaa/ 
 	  \a/  
 	   v 
------------------------------------------------------------[  COMPILATION  ]--

Compilation is made easy through the use of the Make utility. A file included
with the source called Makefile specifies how to derive the target program.

To compile the program, simply do the following in a Linux terminal:

	$make 

If generating new .o files for execution use the following command:

	$make new 

	or

	$make clean 

To run the program after make has finished, type the following:

	$ ./pa1

------------------------------------------------------------[ SAMPLE OUTPUT ]--

An example of normal output... (on stdout)

Argument #1 should be an integer value in the form of 4n+3
Argument #2 should be a single character in the form $'a'

$ ./pa1 7 $'a'

   ^   
  /a\  
 /aaa\ 
/aaaaa\
|aa|aa|
|aa|aa|
\aa\aa/
 \aa\/ 
 /\aa\ 
/aa\aa\
|aa|aa|
|aa|aa|
\aaaaa/
 \aaa/ 
  \a/  
   v  


Examples of abnormal output... (on stderr)

$ ./pa1 7

	Usage: ./pa1 size fillChar
  	size: equal to the maximum width of the Cool S
  	  -- must be in the interval [3, 103]
   	 -- must be of the form (size = 4n + 3)
         where n is some integer
  	fillChar: used for filling in the Cool S
  	  -- must be a single character
   	 -- must be within the ASCII range [32, 126]

$ ./pa1 5 $'a'

	Error: size must be an integer of the format 4n + 3

$ ./pa1 7 '\a'

	Error: fillChar must be a single char

$ ./pa1 300 'a'

	Error: size must be within the range [3, 103]

$ ./pa1 8a '$'

	Error: size must be an integr in base 10

$ ./pa1 99999999999999999999 a
	
	Error when converting size (999....) into base 10: Numerical result out
	of range
------------------------------------------------------------[    TESTING    ]--

I tested my program by comparing its output against the pa1test solution 
contained in the public directory.

Some specific test cases I tried on the executable:
  * Out of range size
  * Size not in the form 4n+3
  * Negative size value
  * ASCII values and chars outside of the range
  * Inputting too few arguments or too many arguments
  * Size with non-digit characters, e.g. a, or #$

VimDiff Questions

1. Q: Spot the 3 differences between average3V1.s and average3V3.s using 
   vimdiff and document them as the answer to this README question. Be clear 
   about the location of the differences. 
   A: The three differences between the average3V1.s and average3V3.s is
      1) at line 17 in both average3V1.s and average3V3.s, average3V1.s contains
      a whitespace after .global before average3, whereas the average3V3.s file
      contains a tab ^I in the same place.
      2) at line 49 in average3V1.s there is an extra tab indentation.
      3) at line 59 in average3V3.s contains a newline.
     
C Questions

2. Q: What line of code needs to be added on line 4 to make the program print?
   A: *x *= 3;
 
3. Q: We have an executable called s. If it is run with the following command,
   what will thevalue of argc in main() be? Why?
   A: The value of argc will be 7 ( argv[0] = ./s , argv[1] = html, ... )
   because argc is the argument count, or the number of strings pointed tob by
   argv.
